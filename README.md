# Scripts

#### Random scripts for random things.

* batterynotification.sh - Battery notification script to show low power made specifically for my ThinkPad 25, but should work fine for other machines.
* colors.sh - A colors script I got from someone on Discord, not made by me.
* currentbattery.sh - Notification script used to show the current battery.
* time.sh - Notification script to show the current time.
